# KTH FLOW presentation (absolutely unofficial)


This is not intended to be an official template, a complete guide, or a very neat latex code. I just put together some things that I've found useful while working with beamer and setting up my presentations.

The colors used are the ones from KTH: (2023)
https://intra.kth.se/en/administration/kommunikation/varumarke/grafiskprofil

The lines on the title page are also from that link which work only for an aspect ratio of 16:9. I split all the corners in different figures so it's easier to move/mirror them.

Check `Example.tex` for an example presentation and some tips on how to use it.
